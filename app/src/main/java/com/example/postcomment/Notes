Note: The viewModelScope property of ViewModel classes is hardcoded to Dispatchers.Main.
 Replace it in tests by calling Dispatchers.setMain and passing in a test dispatcher.

 Note: While you might have seen hardcoded dispatchers in code snippets across this site and our codelabs,
 this is only to keep the sample code concise and simple.
 In your application, you should inject dispatchers.
